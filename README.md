# CSC-421
WINTER 2023

## Course Overview
In this course, students will be introduced to the basics of artificial intelligence. The course follows closely the popular Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach book by Peter Norvig and Stuart Russell. AIMA book website. The students work on a variety of assignments that have mathematical, algorithmic, and programming components building various small scale systems that illustrate fundamental ideas in AI. 

## Topics

    • Solving Problems by Searching
    • Informed Search and Exploration
    • Logic and Inference
    • Knowledge Representation
    • Statistical Methods
    • Machine learning
    • Deep learning

 Course Objectives And Learning Outcomes

The course objectives and learning outcomes are grouped based on the different thematic units of the course. By the end of the course the students will have learned to:

    • Understand the abstraction of agents as a framework for understading AI concepts as well as integrating the various concepts and ideas learned during the course into working systems
    • Formulate various structured problems as search problems and be familiar with the variety of algorithms and associated tradeoffs that can be used to solve them. They will also learn about the efficiency of leveraging structure in Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP).
    • Represent facts and knowledge using logic and understand the principles behind inference systems
    • Be able to communicate about and structure various problems that feature uncertainty using probabilities and probabilistic reasoning
    • Be familiar with the basic terminology of machine learning and using data to train effective algorithms including the more computationally demanding but more effective deep learning approaches
    • Be able to critically think about the ethical and safety implications of building systems using AI technologies
